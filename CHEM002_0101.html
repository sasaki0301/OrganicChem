  <h1>Definition and Brief History of Organic Chemistry</h1>

  <p>
    Organic chemistry is the branch of chemistry that focuses on the study of compounds
    containing carbon, particularly those that include carbon–hydrogen bonds.
    These compounds form the basis of all known life on Earth and are fundamental to many
    industries including pharmaceuticals, fuels, plastics, and food.
  </p>

  <h2>Historical Background</h2>
  <p>
    The term <em>organic</em> was originally used to describe substances derived from living organisms.
    For centuries, scientists believed organic compounds could only be formed through a “vital force” in living things—a belief known as <strong>vitalism</strong>.

    <p><em>Friedrich Wöhler’s synthesis of urea (1828) disproved vitalism and marked the birth of modern organic chemistry.</em></p>
  </div>

  <p>
    In 1828, German chemist <strong>Friedrich Wöhler</strong> synthesized urea (an organic compound)
    from ammonium cyanate (an inorganic compound). This groundbreaking experiment demonstrated that
    organic compounds could be created from inorganic sources, paving the way for
    the development of modern organic chemistry.
